### Hi, I'm Elif ðŸ‘‹

I'm a master's student at the University of Bonn focusing on Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Machine Learning. Also, I'm working as a student research assistant at the [AGROBOTICS](http://agrobotics.uni-bonn.de/group-members/) of the University of Bonn. My responsibilities include researching and implementing vision methods for the challenges in the agricultural vision project.

On this Github page, I share my Computer Vision projects, Deep Learning Projects, notebooks as well as other AI projects, and list them below with brief explanations.

### [Stereo Depth Estimation](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/StereoDepthEstimation)

Implemented PSMNet and GC-Net models using PyTorch Deep Learning Framework. The models have been trained on Driving Dataset, Monkaa Dataset, Flyingthings3D Dataset, tested on Kitti Dataset. To attain the highest result, different ideas have been tried and hyperparameter tuning has been carried out in a variety of experiments.

### [Computer Vision Projects](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/ComputerVisionProjects)

This repository consists of 5 projects:

1. Regression and Classification
2. Decision Forest for Segmentation
3. Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Object Classification
4. Segmentation with k-Means

### [Deep Learning Projects](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/DeepLearningProjects)

This repository contains the following projects:

1. Digit Classification on MNIST
2. Logistic Regression on CIFAR10
3. CNNs on SVHN

### [Machine Learning Notebooks](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/MachineLearningNotebooks)

This repository includes notebooks of a number of ML and optimization methods. The notebooks are listed below:

1. SVM
2. PCA
3. Multi-SOM-Multi-NeuralGas
4. Hopfield Networks
5. Numerical Optimization

### [Deep Learning Notebooks](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/DeepLearningNotebooks)

This repository contains notebooks of mini deep learning tasks on PyTorch framework. 

### [Data Mining Library for Sparkling Water Platform](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/DataMiningLibraryForSparklingWaterPlatform)

Mini data mining library using Spark and H2O framework.

### [Hadoop Netflix Prize Dataset](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/HadoopNetflixPrizeDataset)

Big Data Analysis on Netflix Prize Dataset with Hadoop library.

### [Deep Learning Specialization Notes](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/DeepLearningSpecializationNotes)

My hands-on notes for Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

### [Image Generation Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/ImageGenerationGeneticAlgorithm)

A Genetic Algorithm has been implemented to generate an image similar to the original form.

### [Path Planning Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/PathPlanningGeneticAlgorithm)

A Genetic Algorithm has been implemented to find a suitable path from the start point to the target in the map containing obstacles.
