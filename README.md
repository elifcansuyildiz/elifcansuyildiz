### Hi, I'm Elif ðŸ‘‹

I'm a master's student at the University of Bonn specializing in Machine Learning. 

On this Github page, I share my Computer Vision projects, Deep Learning Projects, notebooks as well as other AI projects, and list them below with brief explanations.

### [Improving Disease Detection with Deep Learning by Examining the Symmetrical Features of the Lungs](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/ImprovingDiseaseDetectionBySymmetricFeatures)

Addresses the lung disease detection problem in chest X-rays. Implemented a symmetry-aware deep learning model which utilizes Siamese Network with DenseNet as a feature extractor. Additionally, developed an alignment module to make the lung fields symmetric in the vertical line. Achieved up to 10% improvement in the AUROC score.

### [Stereo Depth Estimation](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/StereoDepthEstimation)

Implemented PSMNet and GC-Net models using PyTorch Deep Learning Framework. The models have been trained on Driving Dataset, Monkaa Dataset, Flyingthings3D Dataset, tested on Kitti Dataset. To attain the highest result, different ideas have been tried and hyperparameter tuning has been carried out in a variety of experiments.

### [Image Processing Tool](https://github.com/elifcansuyildiz/ImageProcessingQtApplication)

This project provides a Qt user interface for some image processing methods so that the user can play with these methods interactively. Implementations of various image warping methods including fish eye, swirl, waves, cylinder anamorphosis, radial blur, bilinear warping, and perspective mappings are comprised.
